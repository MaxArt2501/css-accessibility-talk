Accessibility... with style!
============================

Slides for a talk about accessibility issues with CSS.

Originally conceived for [CSS Day 2020](https://2020.cssday.it/) in Faenza, 2020-03-13.

Built on top of [P-Slides](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/p-slides)!

## Building

Node.js 12.x is required (actually it could work in Node 10 - haven't checked).

To start the presentation in development mode:

1. Clone the repository;
2. `npm ci`
3. `npm run serve`

Or `npm run build` to just build it, then serve `/public` with your HTTP server of choice.

## Tests

... what?
